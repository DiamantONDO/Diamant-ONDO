Hi, everyone
Here's an overview of my project:
This Advanced Stock Management System is developed as part of my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) assignment, submitted on April 29, 2025. The system is designed to efficiently manage and monitor stock movements in a variety of environments, making it a vital tool for businesses that deal with inventory management.

Using Java and fundamental OOP concepts, the project demonstrates practical applications of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. The system is structured to handle inventory-related operations such as adding new products, updating stock levels, processing transactions, and more.

Features included:
Modular Design: The project is built using Java classes and methods that encapsulate various functionalities, making it easy to maintain and expand.

Stock Management: With features for adding, removing, and updating stock items, the system ensures accurate tracking of inventory.

User-Friendly Interface: The application interacts with users through the terminal using the Scanner class, enabling smooth data entry and interaction.

In a nutshell, my project is a demonstration of how Object-Oriented Programming can be applied to create real-world applications. It serves as a foundation for building more complex inventory and stock management solutions.

Thanks,
